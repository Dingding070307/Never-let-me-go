            <h2>1. Setting</h2>
            
            <div class="content-item" data-keywords="Hailsham, setting, education, fate">
                <h3>Hailsham School</h3>
                <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Hailsham School is the main setting of the story. While it appears to be a typical boarding school, as the story progresses, the dark truth about its purpose is revealed.</p>
                <p><strong>Direct Quote:</strong> "And I’m a Hailsham student—which is enough by itself sometimes to get people’s backs up." — Kathy H. (p.3)</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Hailsham symbolizes a false sense of protection, hiding the true nature of the students' identity. It shapes the main characters' thoughts and behavior, especially their feelings of helplessness and acceptance when confronted with death.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Pavilion was the first place Tommy was bullied. This place is a secret spot where children peep things happening in the field, symbolizing snooping and hidden truths.</p>
